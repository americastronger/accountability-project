# The Demands

1. Create an independent inspector body to investigate police misconduct and criminal allegations and controls evidence like body camera footage. Any use of lethal force shall trigger an automatic investigation by this body.

2. ⁠Create a requirement for states to establish board certification with minimum education and training requirements to provide licensing for police. In order to be a law enforcement officer, you must possess this license. The inspector body in #1 can revoke the license.

3. ⁠Refocus police resources on training, de-escalation, and community building.

4. Adopt the “absolute necessity” doctrine for lethal force as implemented in other states. "I feared for my life" is no longer a valid excuse.

5. ⁠Codify into law the requirement for police to have positive control over the evidence chain of custody. If the chain of custody is lost for evidence, the investigative body in #1 can hold law enforcement officers and their agencies liable.

6. No qualified immunity.

7. Severe penalties if it is found that an illegal act by a police officer was taking place and an officer did not intervene and/or report on the matter after the fact. Any cop who is an accomplice will also be held accountable.
